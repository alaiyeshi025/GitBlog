* 涉及复杂类型的编写技巧
  When you're not sure what to fill in for a value, have it as a \_, GHC will goes like "Found hole `_' with type: ISO (() -> a) (Maybe b0 -> a0). So you can immediately see value of what type are needed.
  This process can be repeat indefinitely.
  For example you might replace `_` with `isoFunc _ _` So GHC hint you on more specific type. This is especially usefull if you have complex type.
  See https://wiki.haskell.org/GHC/Typed_holes And "stepwise refinement" for more details.
